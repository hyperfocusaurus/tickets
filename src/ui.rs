// UI functions needed:
// layout functionality... grid based?
// draw tabs with content view
// draw "card" (title, body, etc.)
// draw rectangle
// render text
// build up more complex components based on rectangles + text, using composition
// "paint" method for each component, paints any sub-components
// "update" method for each component, updates the component state
// work out if need to repaint after update call (check if component has become dirty)
// co-operative - component marks itself as dirty during update
